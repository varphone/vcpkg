The package xtr is compatible with built-in CMake targets via CMake v3.7 and prior syntax

    find_package(fvia REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${FVIA_LIBRARIES})
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${FVIA_INCLUDE_DIR})

and the CMake v3.8 and beyond imported target syntax

    find_package(fvia REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fv::fvia)
    # or
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fvia::fvia)
