The package xtr is compatible with built-in CMake targets via CMake v3.7 and prior syntax

    find_package(xtr REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${XTR_LIBRARIES})
    target_include_directories(main PRIVATE ${XTR_INCLUDE_DIR})

and the CMake v3.8 and beyond imported target syntax

    find_package(xtr REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE xtr::xtr)
